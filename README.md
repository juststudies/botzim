# Bot Music

In this repo has a small music bot for discord server that uses local music folder

## Usage:

install libs (preferred in a virtual environment)<br>
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
``` 

start <br>
```
python main.py
``` 

## Why has a docker-compose file ?

A make this code in a ubuntu system, but needs an .exe, well, I use this [windows](https://github.com/dockur/windows) docker image to generate it.
